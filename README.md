# 08-Breakout
Hello!

This is Project 08 for the Game Technology course at Indiana University.  In this project, I built a brick breaker game from scratch using lessons previously learned in the exercises we did throughout the weeks before the project.

I had some trouble with this assignment in getting the bricks to break and getting the game over message to pop up, but other than that the assignment was not too bad.

Thank you for checking out my work!
